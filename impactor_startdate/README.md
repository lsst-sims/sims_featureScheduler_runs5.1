# impactor startdate

Add the option to set the start date of the survey to arbitrary values. 

For the impactor simulations, the goal is to start simulations at a variety of times in the past, to align with impactor orbits. The UW team (Ian Chow, Mario Juric) have already generated the additional skybrightness, planet, sun_moon and almanac sunsets files that are necessary. They also generated a ddf_grid_fine.npz file that covers the necessary timespan (1994 to present).
